## Overview 

The objective of this project is to build an recommendation system which
returns a collection of users whom share similar profiles and interactions with
a given user of interest. The dataset consists of anonymized user data captured
from an online platform that includes features such as user interests,
assessment scores, course viewing details, and tagged categories.
